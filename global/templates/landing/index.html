        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
            Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
            Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
            Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
            undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
            Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
            theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor
            sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the
            1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et
            Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions
            from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
